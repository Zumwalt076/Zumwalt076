About Me
Hey there! I'm Zumwalt076, a passionate learner and aspiring coder, programmer and a developer. I'm excited to share my journey and projects with you on GitHub. While I may be new to coding, I have a strong drive to make a positive social impact through my work. Currently, I'm focusing on learning Figma and building projects that contribute to solve problems in our society.

Skills and Interests
Figma: 
I am actively learning and improving my skills in Figma. I enjoy exploring its powerful features and creating visually appealing designs.
Social Impact: 
I believe in the power of technology to bring about positive change. I am dedicated to using my skills to build projects that make a meaningful impact on society.
Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

Project Name: Errand Doers PH - You can take a research on Facebook how it works

Project Name #2: El Lote PH - a food brand that tries to be a go to food place for a To Go business concept.

Learning Journey
I'm currently in a phase where I can quickly absorb and process large amounts of information. I'm eager to expand my knowledge and gain a deeper understanding of coding concepts. I may not know everything yet, but I'm always ready to tackle new challenges and learn from experienced developers.
