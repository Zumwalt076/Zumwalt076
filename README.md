Welcome to the GitHub repository for our awesome project! This repository contains the source code, documentation, and resources related to the project. 
Below, you'll find an overview of the project, its features, and how to get started.

## About the Project

FileBlox is designed with digital creators specifically in mind. It combines the power of secure file storage with the ability to tokenize and monetize your creative works on your own terms.

Decentralized Marketplace for Encrypted NFTs,
NFT marketplaces have helped artists, designers, musicians, and content creators engage their patrons, monetizing their works, and reducing the number of intermediaries that stand between them and their audience.

There’s just one famous problem with NFTs that doesn’t seem to go: you can’t turn exclusive content into an NFT because then everyone can see them. Anyone can just download a file from these marketplaces as they wish.

How We Solved it?

We believe that some digital files are valuable assets that need protection from piracy and unauthorized use. So we created a way for people to tokenize their digital creations while only making them accessible to people who legitimately paid for them.

So how does it work?

Content creator will upload the file along with its properties like name, price, description.. and also a cover image that will be used as the image placeholder for the encrypted NFT in the marketplace.

The backend will automatically upload the file to IPFS, encrypt its location, and then return a hash that will be minted as a property to the NFT

Once somebody has paid to mint the NFT, they can now view it on their user dashboard.

When they click download, FileBlox checks if they own the NFT that contains the hash. If they do, it will be decrypted and the user is led to the location of the file.
